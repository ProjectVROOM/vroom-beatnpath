Hello!

Just to make a note about measurements:

- horizontally, the three subdivisions are each 3 feet, making it 9 feet across
-going down the path, each section is in incriments of ten (an 800 ft. track has 80 subdivisions)
- these layouts don't include the portions of the track that are outside the cave
